# gh-lgtm

There are far too many steps to open a PR, comment "LGTM ðŸš€" on it and then approve it (without actually reviewing).

This GitHub CLI (`gh`) extension makes life easy. Don't really care about a PR? Just `gh lgtm` it!

## Installation
```
gh extension install shakti365/gh-lgtm
```

## Usage
```
gh lgtm [<number> | <url> | <branch>]
```

## Disclaimer

This extension was created as satire on the common PR reviews workflow. I don't endorse this behavior, but you can still use this extension once you have _actually_ reviewed the PR Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Should probably test this!
